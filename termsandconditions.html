            Data obtained from you in connection with this SMS service may
            include your mobile phone number, your carrier's name and the date,
            time and content of your messages. We may use this information to
            contact you and provide the services you request from us. Alerts
            sent via SMS may not be delivered if the mobile phone is not in
            range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is
            not available at a particular time. Even within a coverage area,
            factors beyond the control of the wireless operator may interfere
            with message delivery, including the customer's equipment, terrain,
            proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather. The wireless operator
            does not guarantee that alerts will be delivered and will not be
            held liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
